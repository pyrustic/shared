**Shared** is an experimental data exchange and persistence solution based on human-readable files. It serves as a playground to test new ideas and then create stable derivative projects. I recently built a **multi-model embedded database for persisting arbitrary-sized data.** The project is called **[Jinbase](https://github.com/pyrustic/jinbase/)** and I strongly encourage you to give it a [try](https://github.com/pyrustic/jinbase/).

# Overview
**Shared** is a Python package created to be the programmer's companion when it comes to storing unstructured application data, managing configuration files, caching data, and exchanging data with other programs.

Under the hood, Shared uses [Paradict](https://github.com/pyrustic/paradict) to encode a dictionary populated with **strings**, **scalars** (integer, float, decimal float, complex, booleans), **date** and **time**, **null** value, **binary** data and nested **collections** (list, set, and dictionary).

> **Note:** This library doesn't perform any synchronization and thus simultaneous access to a file might lead to data corruption. **For a safe, more robust persistence solution, please consider [Jinbase](https://github.com/pyrustic/jinbase).**

# Example
```python
from shared import Dossier, HOME
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path

# load a picture
with open("/home/alex/image.png", "rb") as file:
    photo = file.read()

# create a user profile dictionary embedding the picture
now = datetime.now()
profile = {"name": "alex", "access_datetime": now, "photo": photo,
           "pi": 3.14, "books": ["Seul sur Mars", "The Fall"],
           "is_author": True, "fingerprint": None}

# create a dossier (or access an existing one)
path = Path(HOME, "my_dossier")
dossier = Dossier(path)

# save profile dictionary in the dossier
dossier.set("my_profile", profile)

# retrieve profile dictionary
profile_bis = dossier.get("my_profile")

# let's compare the two profile objects !
assert profile == profile_bis  # True ;)
```
