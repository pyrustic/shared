# Overview
**Shared** is a Python package created to be the programmer's companion when it comes to storing application data, managing configuration files, caching data, and exchanging data with other programs.

Although a lightweight package, **Shared** smoothly handles collections (**dict**, **list**, **set**), **binary** data, and **SQL** queries.

## Designed as a triptych

**Shared**'s intuitive application programming interface is designed as a  [triptych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptych). Thus, three classes with similar interfaces are created to cover the needs of data exchange and persistence: `Document`, `Dossier`, and `Database`.

|Class|Relevance|
|---|---|
|`Document`|For individual access to [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) files that are likely to be **manually edited by a human**.|
|`Dossier`|To store collections and binary data in a dossier **without worrying about how they are actually saved**.|
|`Database`|For an intuitive interaction with [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) **databases**.|

> **Note:** The `Document` class is not intended to be used directly. Instead, depending on the requirement, one will use the `JsonDoc` class which subclasses the `Document` class.

## Some characteristics
Since all three classes share similar interfaces, some handy functionality has been replicated in all of them with a few exceptions.

### Initialization
All three classes emphasize **initialization**:
- `Document` and `Dossier` give the possibility to define **default data**.
- `Database` allows the definition of an **initialization SQL script** which is only executed to create a new database.

### Data access
All three classes provide an optional **read-only** access to data and also allow the creation of **temporary data** which is automatically deleted when the user closes the application.

`Document` and `Dossier` provide **Autosave** functionality, while `Database` automatically closes the underlying database connection when the user closes the application.

### Command-line interface

Among the three classes, `Dossier` is the class of which a single instance can handle multiple underlying files. The `Dossier` class has its own protocol for organizing data. For this reason, `Dossier` offers a simple yet powerful **command-line interface** that allows other programs or a human to read and write the contents of a dossier.

<br>

Let's explore the [Document](#document), [Dossier](#dossier), and [Database](#database) classes in the next sections !

# Document
The `Document` class represents an interface for reading and writing an underlying file whose format is [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

As stated previously in the [Overview](#overview) section, the `Document` class is not intended to be used directly. Instead, depending on the requirement, one will use the `JsonDoc` class which subclasses the `Document` class. 

Since **JSON** is very popular, we will focus on the `JsonDoc` class in the following examples.

Accessing a document or creating a new one is as simple as this:

```python
from shared import JsonDoc

# Create a new document instance which will be linked to the 'my-data.json' file.
# If this file doesn't exist yet, it will be automatically created
document = JsonDoc("my-data.json")

# From now, we can use 'document' to read and write the contents of 'my-data.json' !
# ...
```

The string `my-data.json` is the base name of a file that will be created if it does not yet exist. This string is called **Target** and can be an absolute path or an instance of [pathlib.Path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html). The `Document` class exposes the `read` and `write` methods, respectively, to read and write the underlying document.



## Initialization
A document can be initialized with a conditional statement or by defining default data. By default, the `Document` class will assign a `dict` to the null parameter `default_data`.

### Use a conditional statement
It's as simple as testing a boolean to check if the underlying document file is newly created or not:

```python
from shared import JsonDoc

# access 'my-data.json'
document = JsonDoc("my-data.json")

# let's initialize the content of 'my-data.json'
if document.new:
    data = {"name": "alex", "job": "evangelist"}
    document.write(data)  # persisted !
```

### Set default data
The most elegant, less verbose and recommended way to initialize a document is to set some default data to the `default` parameter:

```python
from shared import JsonDoc

# default data to init the file 'my-data.json'
DEFAULT_DATA = {"name": "alex", "job": "evangelist"}

# access 'my-data.json'
document = JsonDoc("my-data.json", default=DEFAULT_DATA)

# From now, thanks to the initialization functionality, the underlying
# document contains the default data, assuming that 'my-data.json'
# did not exist before the `Document` class was instantiated
```

## Data location
The only mandatory argument to be supplied to the `Document` class constructor is the `target`. For convenience, the `target` is either the absolute path or the base name of a file. Its data type is either a string or an instance of [pathlib.Path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html).

The optional `directory` parameter exists to supplement the `target` value when that value is not an absolute path.

### Default directory
By default, document files are saved in `$HOME/PyrusticHome/shared`. You can change the location according to your needs:

```python
from shared import JsonDoc

DIRECTORY = "/home/alex/private"

# access 'my-data.json'
document = JsonDoc("my-data.json", directory=DIRECTORY)

# From now, you can access these properties:
#   document.name == "my-data.json"
#   document.directory == "/home/alex/private"
#   document.target == "my-data.json"

```

### Absolute pathname
You can set an absolute path as the target. In this case, the `Document` class ignores the `directory` parameter.

```python
from shared import JsonDoc

pathname = "/home/alex/private/my-data.json"

# access 'my-data.json'
document = JsonDoc(pathname)

# From now, you can access these properties:
#   document.name == "my-data.json"
#   document.directory == "/home/alex/private"
#   document.target == "/home/alex/private/my-data.json"
```

### Temporary data
Setting the `temporary` boolean can enable temporary mode, so a document can only be created and used while the application is running, and then safely deleted when the application closes:

```python
from shared import JsonDoc

# access 'my-data.json'
document = JsonDoc("my-data.json", temporary=True)

# This document will be created in a temporary directory
# then it will be safely deleted when the application closes
# or when the developer explicitly calls the 'close' or 'delete' method
```

The `Document` class uses [tempfile.TemporaryDirectory](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.TemporaryDirectory) to implement this functionality.


## Autosave
Thanks to [atexit](https://docs.python.org/3/library/atexit.html) module, `Document` can autosave content when the application is closed:

```python
import sys
from shared import JsonDoc

# access 'my-config.json' with `autosave` mode enabled
document = JsonDoc("my-config.json", autosave=True, default=[])
# load the data
data = document.read()

# few lines of code later...

data.append("batman")  # data modified

sys.exit()  # data automatically saved !
```
Along with `atexit` module, the `Document` class also uses a caching mechanism to implement the `autosave` functionality.

## Caching
By default, `caching` mode is enabled, so the user can access cached data through the `cache` property of an instance of the `Document` class:

```python
from shared import JsonDoc

DEFAULT_DATA = {"name": "alex", "job": "evangelist"}

# access 'my-config.json'
document = JsonDoc("my-config.json", caching=True, default=DEFAULT_DATA)

data = document.read()

if data is document.cache:
    print("Same same !")
```

## Readonly
Setting the `readonly` parameter to `True` prevents the running application from accidentally modifying the content of a document:

```python
from shared import JsonDoc

# access 'my-data.json'
document = JsonDoc("my-data.json", readonly=True)

# when you set readonly to True, you can no longer edit the content !
# shared.ReadonlyError will be raised if you try to mess with a readonly document

```

## Clear data
You can delete the underlying file of a document (assuming the file isn't in readonly mode):

```python
from shared import JsonDoc

# access 'my-data.json'
document = JsonDoc("my-data.json")

# delete 'my-data.json'
document.delete()

if document.deleted:
    print("Successfully deleted !")
```

## Convenience functions
Four convenience functions are available for the `JsonDoc` class:

```python
from shared import json_create, json_readonly, json_write, json_autosave

# quickly create a document
DEFAULT = ["red", "violet"]
json_create("my-data.json", default=DEFAULT)

# quickly open a document in readonly mode
data = json_readonly("my-data.json")

# quickly change the content of a document
data = ["red", "green"]
json_write("my-data.json", data)

# quickly read the content of a document in autosave mode
data = json_autosave("my-data.json")
data.append("blue")  # data will be automatically saved on exit
```

## Recapitulation
For individual access to [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) files that are likely to be **manually edited by a human**, the `Document` class is the recommended interface.

For more technical details about this class and the subclasses `JsonDoc`, read the [reference documentation](https://github.com/pyrustic/shared/tree/master/docs/modules#readme).

# Dossier
The `Dossier` class stores collections (**list**, **dict**, **set**) and **binary data** with a unified interface inside a [dossier](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/dossier). **Shared** allows to read and write a dossier not only programmatically but also from the [command line](#command-line-interface).

This class shares a similar interface with the `Document` class. Thus, the `Dossier` class constructor has `target`, `directory`, `autosave`, `readonly` and `temporary` as parameters. These parameters are already covered in the `Document` class [section](#document).

Under the hood, `Dossier` uses [files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file) and [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) to store data.

## Example
Let's create a dossier with **script_1.py**:

```python
# script_1.py
from shared import Dossier

# data
people = {"Jack": "male", "Jane": "female"}  # dict
planets = ["Mars", "Venus", "Jupiter"]  # list
colors = {"red", "green", "blue"}  # set

# let's persist the data in 'my-dossier'
dossier = Dossier("my-dossier")
dossier.set("people", people)  # set the 'people' entry
dossier.set("planets", planets)  # set the 'planets' entry
dossier.set("colors", colors)  # set the 'colors' entry

# Done ! The data is persisted !
```

From **script_2.py**, let's access the dossier created with **script_1.py**:
```python
# script_2.py
from shared import Dossier

# let's access the shared dossier
dossier = Dossier("my-dossier")

# get data from the shared dossier
people = dossier.get("people") # get the 'people' entry
planets = dossier.get("planets") # get the 'planets' entry'
colors = dossier.get("colors") # get the 'colors' entry

print(people)
# output: {'Jack': 'male', 'Jane': 'female'}

print(planets)
# output: ['Mars', 'Venus', 'Jupiter']

print(set(colors)) # there is nothing called 'set' in JSON [1]
# output: {'red', 'green', 'blue'}


# [1] the value of 'colors' is this dictionary:
# {'red': None, 'green': None, 'blue': None}
```

## Binary data
You can store binary data with the same unified interface:

```python
# script_1.py
from shared import Dossier

dossier = Dossier("my-dossier")

with open("/home/alex/selfie.png", "rb") as file:
    data = file.read()
    dossier.set("selfie", data)  # set the 'selfie' entry

# the 'set' method returns the path to the binary file that stores the binary entry
```

The above code can also be expressed like this:

```python
# script_1.py
import pathlib
from shared import Dossier

dossier = Dossier("my-dossier")

path = pathlib.Path("/home/alex/selfie.png")
dossier.set("selfie", path)  # set the 'selfie' entry

# the 'set' method returns the path to the binary file that stores the binary entry
```

You can retrieve your binary data from another script:
```python
# script_2.py
from shared import Dossier
from shutil import copyfile

dossier = Dossier("my-dossier")
source_path = dossier.get("selfie")  # get the filename of the 'selfie' bin entry
destination_path = "/home/alex/new.png"

# copy the content from source to destination
copyfile(source_path, destination_path)

```

## Check
Use the `check` method to check the contents of a dossier or a specific entry:

```python
from shared import Dossier

dossier = Dossier("my-dossier")

# check a specific entry
info = dossier.check("entry")
if info:
    # info is a 3-tuple (name, container, filename).
    # The name is simply the entry name.
    # The container is a string that represents the type of the entry.
    # containers: "dict", "list", "set", and "bin"
    # The filename is either the path to a JSON file or a binary file
    name, container, filename = info

# check the contents of the dossier
dossier_info = dossier.check()  # returns a dict, keys are entries and values are 3-tuples

for entry, info in dossier_info.items():
    print("Entry:", info.name) # the entry name
    print("Container:", info.container)  # 'dict', 'set', 'list', or 'bin'
    print("Filename:", info.filename) # the underlying file in which the data is stored
    print()
```


## Clear data
You can decide to delete a specific entry, a group of entries, or the dossier:

```python
from shared import Dossier

dossier = Dossier("my-dossier")

# delete a specific entry
dossier.delete("entry_1")

# delete a group of entries
dossier.delete("entry_2", "entry_3")

# delete the dossier
dossier.delete()  # collections, binary data, and meta data are gone
```

## Recapitulation
To store collections and binary data in a dossier **without worrying about how they are actually saved**, the `Dossier` class is the interface to use.

For more technical details about this class, read its [documentation](https://github.com/pyrustic/shared/blob/master/docs/modules/content/shared/content/classes/Dossier.md#class-dossier).


# Database
Intuitive interaction with **SQLite** databases.

## Example
The following example shows how nice it is to work with the `Database` class:

```python
from shared import Database

# Initialization script
# This SQL script will create two tables: friends and projects
INIT_SCRIPT = """\
CREATE TABLE friends (name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
                      age INTEGER NOT NULL);

CREATE TABLE projects (name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
                       language TEXT NOT NULL);
"""

# If this database doesn't exist yet,
# it will be created with the initialization script
database = Database("my-database", init_script=INIT_SCRIPT)

# This will only be executed once !
# So you can safely restart this script again and again...
if database.new:
    # Populate this database
    sql = """INSERT INTO friends VALUES ("Jack", 20)"""
    database.edit(sql)

    # few lines of code later...

    # Populate this database
    sql = """INSERT INTO friends VALUES (?, ?)"""
    parameters = ("Jane", 21)
    database.edit(sql, param=parameters)

# Read data
sql = "SELECT * FROM friends"
columns, data = database.query(sql)  # returns a shared.dto.QueryResult namedtuple

print(columns)
# output: ['name', 'age']

print(data)
# output: [('Jack', 20), ('Jane', 21)]

```

For more technical details about this class, read its [documentation](https://github.com/pyrustic/shared/blob/master/docs/modules/content/shared/content/classes/Database.md#class-database).


# Command line interface
**Shared** comes with an intuitive command line interface for the `Dossier` class. Type `help` in the command line interface to display a short manual.

For the following subsections, assume we have a pre-populated dossier named `my-dossier` and located in `/home/alex/dossiers`.

## Check the content
Check the contents of `my-dossier` or a specific entry:
```bash
$ cd /home/alex/dossiers/my-dossier

$ shared check
- 'colors' set 56B
- 'people' dict 44B
- 'planets' list 42B

$ shared check people
'people' dict 44B

$ shared check colors
'colors' set 56B
```

## Read the content of a specific entry

```bash
$ cd /home/alex/dossiers/my-dossier

$ shared get people
{
    "Jack": "male",
    "Jane": "female"
}

$ shared get planets
[
    "Mars",
    "Venus",
    "Jupiter"
]

shared get colors
{
    "red": null,
    "blue": null,
    "green": null
}

```
The output text is the exact **JSON** representation as stored in a file. So the **output can be consumed as is** by another program and deserialized with a **JSON** library. Note that the `colors` entry is a `set` but represented as a `dict` in **JSON**.

## Store binary data
```bash
$ shared set selfie bin: '/home/alex/selfie.png'
Entry successfully updated !
```

You can copy a binary entry into an arbitrary file from the command line:

```bash
$ shared get selfie > '/home/alex/selfie-copy.png'
```

## Store a collection
```bash
$ shared set countries list: '/home/alex/countries.json'
Entry successfully updated !

$ shared set my_config dict: '/home/alex/app_config.json'
Entry successfully updated !
```

## Delete an entry

```bash
$ shared del "selfie"
Entry successfully deleted !

$ shared check selfie
This entry doesn't exist.
```

## Delete a dossier
Right-click on the folder with your mouse, then send it safely to the trash... ;)
